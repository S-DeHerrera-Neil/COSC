Gorgas Exploit Development (GED)
XX Mar 2023
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: DEVOPS

Objective:Gorgas Cyber Forces have been able to retrieve copies of the files for your analysis, and stored them under /longTermStorage; however, you will be required to perform your exploits on the target systems. Maneuver through Donovian network, and successfully develop exploit to gain host access.

Tools/Techniques: Exploit binaries on target systems using the tools below.

    Python
    OllyDBG or an equivelent graphical program
        http://www.ollydbg.de/
    GNU Debugger's(GDB) Python Exploit Development Assistance Module
        https://github.com/longld/peda
    MetaSploit
        https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Nightly-Installers

Scenario Credentials: FLAG = 3XPL01T5t@rt0F@ct1v1ty

Prior Approvals: Gorgas Cyber Forces have been able to retrieve copies of the files for your analysis; however, you will be required to perform your exploits on the target systems. Exploit Donovian-Webserver, Donovian-Terminal, and Donovian-Manager hosts.

ELF Exploitation 1
8
Level III Challenge

Situation: Other teams have extracted this networked binary from a Donovian development network. It is believed to closely related to software running in both the Donovian and Gorgan internal networks. Discover vulnerabilities and create a reliable exploit to gain remote access. This will enable exploitation against Donovian targets and provide the basis for developing mitigations on friendly Gorgan networks. You will be required to exfil a copy from the target to your Op Station.

Provided: Executable Package: ```inventory.exe```
Task: Perform a ```local buffer overflow``` on the vulnerable Linux executable, in order to gain access to the desired intel.
Method: Utilize RE toolset and python to launch and develop exploit.

```ASLR is disabled on the target machine```.

Exploit this binary found on 192.168.28.111 at /.hidden/inventory.exe to escalate privileges from your pivot user to root.

Enter the contents of /.secret/.verysecret.pdb as the flag
